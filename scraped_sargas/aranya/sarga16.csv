https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga16/aranyasans16.htm,[],"The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is  a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed  to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, <em>vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya</em> , and that which is  pious and merited <em>puNyam vedaischa samamatam</em> at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is  the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord  with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology, <em>veda-anga : jyotiShya</em> . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda. <em>uShaa  vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka</em>  Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s."

And <em>vasanta</em> post autumnal  season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and  after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. <em>varSa</em> rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter  of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do  explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said: <em>vedopabR^ihmaNaartham  pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa  lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam  kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam  iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam</em>"
