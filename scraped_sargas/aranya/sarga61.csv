This may not be taken as a mere 'weeping' or 'bemoaning' of the principal character of the epic, but  this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero  to have his romantic attributes, <font color=""#B3003A"">naayaka lakshaNaaH</font> and these 'wailings'  will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries,  which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence,  this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism."
