Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his  own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring  noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but  having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be,  Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night  there."

Not the above mentioned deer, but very big, blaring animals. The thrust of his arrows  made the carcasses of those massive animals fall before the demon Kabandha. Kabandha is a cursed angle  and will be released of his curse later by Rama. This Kabandha has no body parts below his chest, but  has long hands with which he captures his prey that comes within the ambit of his long and strong hands.  Kabandha is thus fed upon the kill of Rama, because Kabandha is a keynote character in giving information  to Rama, and he is to be kept alive till such time. But all this is unknown to other in-mates of the  hermitage, including Seetha. The next morning Rama, in a personal conversation with Seetha, reveals  what he has done during the previous night, to her surprise and praise.</font>"
