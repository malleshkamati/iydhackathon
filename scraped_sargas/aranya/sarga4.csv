https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga4/aranyasans4.htm,[],"The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed  that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill  Viraadha. <em>aadhyaatma raamaayana</em> which occurs in theÂ  chapter 61 of <em>brahmaanmda puraana</em> also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama  affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too.  A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from  Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she  is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess  Lakshmi. Our concern here is with <em>skaanda purana</em> , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode  is explained detailedly. The <em>skaanda puraana</em> puts it as:"
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga4/aranyasans4.htm,[],"On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, "" She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also  release from the bondage [of demon's body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal  Her ."" etc. Hence <em>vi raadha</em> meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased  and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama  and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones  the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees."
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga4/aranyasans4.htm,[],"Again in <em>skaanda puraana</em>, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the <em>phala shruti</em> [Fruit  of Listening] it is narrated as:"
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga4/aranyasans4.htm,[],"<h4 class=""tat""> "" Those that always listen or let listen this episode of virAdha, all their sins are absolved, undoubtedly .. skaanda pauraana</h4>"
