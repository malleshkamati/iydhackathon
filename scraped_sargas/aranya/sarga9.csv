https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga9/aranyasans9.htm,[],"This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana,  where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons.  Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number  of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory  in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard  the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow..."" as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning  immediately at 3-9-27, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam  says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without  resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way. <em>ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad  abhipraayakatvaat ||</em>"
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga9/aranyasans9.htm,[],"She is inquisitive to know  why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are  having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven  with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to  heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons.  And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point.  Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is  the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the  sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance."
