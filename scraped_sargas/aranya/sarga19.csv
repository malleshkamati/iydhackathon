First she  approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach  Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per <em>anyonya sadR^ishau viirau</em>   'those darers  are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers  they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this  situation occurred due to both of them' as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can,  with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with  their glorious aspects, so far by her."

So Rama is with <em>niratishaya  ruupa samR^iddhi</em>   'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha."

But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The  lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha.
