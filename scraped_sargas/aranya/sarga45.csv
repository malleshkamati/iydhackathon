https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga45/aranyasans45.htm,[],"This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration.  The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether  Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature  as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some  rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against  her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called  a woman who is <em>bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi</em> 'blinded by the devotement to her  husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk."
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga45/aranyasans45.htm,[],"This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is <em>raama ayana</em> and becomes <em>raamaayaNa</em> when  compounded. Again <em>raama</em> is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also <em>raamaa</em> as  said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:"
https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga45/aranyasans45.htm,[],"Thus this epic is called <em>raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam</em> 'the peregrination of Seetha and  Rama...' where the first word <em>raamaa</em> with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the  second <em>raama</em> with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination  of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move,  and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation  occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated,  good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that  of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no  oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote."
