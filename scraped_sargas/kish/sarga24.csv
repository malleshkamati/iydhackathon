The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical  editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional  versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four  verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is  overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in  all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter,  it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja and others  have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses  uttered by Tara, which is included here also."
