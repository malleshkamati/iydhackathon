https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/kish/sarga33/kishkindhasans33.htm,[],"This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. Here Sugreeva  is indulged in bodily pleasures with his own females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by Shurpanakha, Ravana is  hankering after other's women. Here Sugreeva dizzy with drinks and in Aranya Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy.  These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with <em>raaja niiti shastra</em>  'political science.' Here the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana,  whereas Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of total 66 verses that are here in  this traditional edition, verses from 25 to 62 are unavailable in critical edition, perhaps estimating them to  be lateral interpolations, and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition  of 'kingly vices...' on which Tara rationally defends."
