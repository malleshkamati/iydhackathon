They looked as though conducted by the mind's  eyes of Hanuma, who is adored by living beings as having good stupendous swiftness, they having resolved  to fulfill the purpose of Rama and to attain a great glory, having accomplished the purpose and duly  determined to complete the task. All of them were looking up at narrating the previous pleasant tidings  and taking delight in war. All of them, in high spirits, were judging rightly the vengeance of Rama  against the evil-minded Ravana."
